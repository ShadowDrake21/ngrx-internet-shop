# InternetShop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

The largest and in my opinion the best application what I've created so far with NgRX, RxJS, Firebase and Fake store api (https://fakeapi.platzi.com/)

## How to work with the app?

There are two modes: authorized and as a guest. Guest can only watch products, search them, work with categories. Purchases, favourites and another user functionality are not available for unauthorized guest. On the other hand, the one who signed in or signed up can do everything they want: make puchases, work with cart, work with user section, add and remove products from favourites and so on.

## Technology stack

Angular, NgRX, RxJS, Firebase, Stripe (https://github.com/ShadowDrake21/ngrx-internet-shop-stripe-backend)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
